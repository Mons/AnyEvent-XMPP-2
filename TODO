'x' means: is done!

- make ssl verify switchable, remove ability to give context to starttls.
- make AnyEvent::XMPP::IM the promised short-cut solution.

X replace Net::LibIDN with Unicode::Stringprep and Net::IDN::Encode possibly?
  X maybe just use Unicode::Stringprep in case we have non-ascii JIDs.
  X => maybe write a test to test my implementation against Net::LibIDN over the
       unicode range.
  - implement ascii parts of IDNA myself and if it gets more complicated
    ignore it for now. maybe even copy code from Net::IDN::Encode or
    failover to Net::LibIDN.

- update docs:
   - AnyEvent::XMPP         - rewrite after other docs are done (mostly done)
   - AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext    - review after rewrote other extensions. (mostly done)
   - AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::* - skim over them after finished other docs (still some undocumented ones)
      - AE::XMPP::Ext::MUC
      - AE::XMPP::Ext::Presence
   - AE::XMPP::IM, AE::XMPP::Stream::Client

- write extensions to new API:
   - Ext::Pubsub
   - Ext::VCardAvatar
   X Ext::VCard


X make ::XMPP::Node store the prefixes of the namespaces and
  have them accessible.
- write tests for Ext::MUC
  - muc should timeout the parts
    and remove internal things. or BS should do that...
  - check that the part timeout works!
X write Ext::Delay
  X write tests for it!
X write Ext::MsgTracker
  - write tests for it!
X finish test: t/z_09_pres_prio.t
- document new extensions
- find solution for sorting out which presence belong to MUC

- document new_* functions in Util
   - rewrite documentation about add() and simxml().
- cleanup IM w.r.t. jid/account handling
X keep an eye on disco_feature stuff.
- fix MUC documentation!
   - make MUC auto-ping itself, to detect erros when the other end
     restarts.
X make the MUC extension not be tied to a specific connection.
  Let it discover new connections itself.
  => for this the join_room function might need a connection argument
     to discover the right connection. => maybe use the %args hash for this,
     as the default should be 'the first' connection we can grab.
  => think about get_room and the implications in general that 'multiple'
     connections are handled by one extension.
- vcard retrieve sends out presence, but the 'last sent presence' info
  isn't available in the connection or to the vcard extension.
  => introduce storing the 'last sent presence' and offer a 'send_presence_update'
  method (at least internally), to repeat the last sent presence (be careful
  not to repeat directed presences!).
   - think more about $dont_retrieve_vcard.
- make exponential falloff in Client.pm when an account couldn't be connected.
- remove XML::Twig dependency from debug => ...
- map the domain part correctly w.r.t. IDNA
- rename 'domain' parameter to 'host',
  and rename the internal host/port to peer_host and
  peer_port.
- add nick_change to documentation
- implement more of XEP-0045: Multi-User Chat
- write a tutorial for simxml
X improve the SSL/TLS handling
- make more tests
   - data forms
   - jabber component
- fix the inaviodable memoryleaks with the callbacks
  the circular object structs.
- put some serious stuff in the synopsises
X look at attribute namespace preservation! (if they got
  prefixes, how to parse this with expat?
  see also http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#scoping-defaulting )
X fix problem that xml::writer writes after <stream/> ahs been written
  X reproduce by conflicting resources!
X test the xml parse error object somehow!
- add context field to IQ error for all the places origin from IQ errors
  (bind_error, session_error, ...)
X AnyEvent::XMPP::Client
  X find a way to distinguish presences from JIDs that
    are in multiple account's roster.
- AnyEvent::XMPP missing functionality to be RFC 3920 conform:
   - improve error handling for SASL to
     support retries as specified in RFC 3920.
     (eg. by supporting a method sasl_retry() which takes
      the changed credentials)
   - IDNA domain name stuff
   x SRV record lookup
      - weight handling!
- AnyEvent::XMPP::IM missing functionality to be RFC 3921 conform:
   - 7.2.  Business Rules
- Implement XEP-0115: Entity Capabilities
- Implement XEP-0190: Best Practice for Closing Idle Streams
x Implement XEP-0030: Service Discovery
   - see also: XEP-0128: Service Discovery Extensions
   - missing feature: building up a item tree for discovery
- see also: grep 'XXX\|FIXME\|TODO' * -r
  - lib/AnyEvent/XMPP/Writer.pm: # XXX: removed authname, because it
                                    ensures maximum connectivitiy
long term?
==========

- Maybe implement XEP-0146: Remote Controlling Clients
X Implement XEP-0082: XMPP Date and Time Profiles
   W provide maybe _to functions for the old format,
     it's still in use out there
X make dns resolution async!
X keep an eye on:
   X TLS: implemented, just do some extensive testing WRT blocking,
          i don't trust the current way the watchers are handled,
          i'm in fear of deadlocks...
