=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Disco - Service discovery manager class for XEP-0030

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $disco = $im->add_ext ('Disco');

   $disco->set_identity ('client', 'console', 'AnyEvent::XMPP');

   $disco->request_items ($jid, 'romeo@montague.net', undef,
      sub {
         my ($disco, $items, $error) = @_;
         if ($error) { print "ERROR:" . $error->string . "\n" }
         else {
            ... do something with the $items ...
         }
      }
   );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extension represents a service discovery manager.

This class is derived from L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext> and can be added as extension
to objects that implement the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Extendable> interface or derive
from it.

This extension will fetch information about the registered extensions on the
extended object (that is extended using the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Extension> API)
and generate discovery information according to their feedback.

To provide content for item discoveries and other things for disco nodes there
are the three events C<identities>, C<features> and C<items> to let you handle
disco queries which are directed to you.

         $$rname = $self->{iden_name};

         for my $cat (keys %{$self->{iden}}) {
            for my $type (keys %{$self->{iden}->{$cat}}) {
               push @$identities, [$cat, $type]
            }
         }
      },
      features => sub {

         return if defined $node; # only top node

         push @$features, keys %{$self->{hardcoded_feat} || {}};
         $self->{extendable}->event (discover_features => $features);
      },
   );
}

=item $disco->set_identity ($category, $type, $name)

This sets the identity of the top info node.

C<$name> is optional and can be undef.  Please note that C<$name> will
overwrite all previous set names! If C<$name> is undefined then
no previous set name is overwritten.

For a list of valid identites look at:

   http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/disco-categories.html

Valid identity C<$type>s for C<$category = "client"> may be:

   bot
   console
   handheld
   pc
   phone
   web

=cut

sub set_identity {
   my ($self, $category, $type, $name) = @_;
   $self->{iden_name} = $name;
   $self->{iden}->{$category}->{$type} = 1;
}

=item $disco->unset_identity ($category, $type)

This function removes the identity C<$category> and C<$type>.
If C<$type> is not defined the whole C<$category> is unset.

=cut

sub unset_identity {
   my ($self, $category, $type) = @_;

   if (defined $type) {
      delete $self->{iden}->{$category}->{$type};
   } else {
      delete $self->{iden}->{$category};
   }
}

=item $disco->enable_feature ($uri, $uri2, ...)

This method enables the feature C<$uri>, where C<$uri>
should be one of the values from the B<Name> column on:

   http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/disco-features.html

You can pass also a list of features you want to enable to C<enable_feature>!

Please note that you should rather just derive from L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext>
and overwrite the C<disable_feature> method to return the feature URIs.
That way this extension can automatically keep track of the extensions
that are available.

sub enable_feature {
   my ($self, @feature) = @_;

}

=item $disco->disable_feature ($uri, $uri2, ...)

This method disables the feature C<$uri>, where C<$uri>
should be one of the values from the B<Name> column on:

   http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/disco-features.html

You can pass also a list of features you want to disable to C<disable_feature>!

This method does send a items request to the JID entity C<$dest> from the
source C<$jid>. C<$node> is the optional node to send the request to, which
can be undef.

The callback C<$cb> will be called when the request returns with 3 arguments:

undef) in C<$items> and an L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Error::IQ> object in C<$error>
when an error occured and no items were received.

This method does send a info request to the JID entity C<$dest> from the
resource C<$jid>. C<$node> is the optional node to send the request to, which
can be undef.

The callback C<$cb> will be called when the request returns with 3 arguments:
The disco handle C<$disco>, an L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Disco::Info> object (or

=head1 EVENTS

=over 4

=item features => $iqnode, $node, $features

This event is emitted whenever a disco info query is answered.
C<$iqnode> is the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Node> of the IQ get.

C<$node> is the discovery info 'node', which is undef in case
the query is directed to the top node.

C<$features> is an array reference you can fill with the
features of the C<$node>.

=item identities => $iqnode, $node, $identities, $rname

This event is emitted whenever a disco info query is answered.
C<$iqnode> is the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Node> of the IQ get.

C<$node> is the discovery info 'node', which is undef in case
the query is directed to the top node.

C<$identities> is an array reference which you can fill with this
sort of entries:

   push @$identities, [$category, $type];

Please consult XEP-0030 about the meaning of C<$category> and C<$type>
with regard to disco info identities.

C<$rname> is a reference to a scalar holding the name of the identities.

=item items => $iqnode, $node, $items

This event is emitted whenever a disco items query is answered.
C<$iqnode> is the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Node> of the IQ get.

C<$node> is the discovery items 'node', which is undef in case
the query is directed to the top node.

C<$items> is an array reference you can fill with this kind of entries:

   push @$items, [$jid, $name, $node];

C<$name> and C<$node> are optional in such an entry and can be undef.
About more details of the items mechanism consult XEP-0030.

=item generated_info_reply => $iqnode

=item generated_items_reply => $iqnode

These events are emitted shortly before the C<$iqnode> disco info/items reply
is sent out. You may use this event to add custom data to the
reply, for example according to XEP-0128.
