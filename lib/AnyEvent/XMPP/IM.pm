=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::XMPP::IM - An XMPP instant messaging client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This class acts as highlevel XMPP client. It derives connection management from
L<AnyEvent::XMPP::CM> and adds some extensions and default behaviour for you.

This module will load some extensions for you as stated in the next section
(L<Extensions>). You can always customize the extensions by getting them via
the C<get_ext> method (see also L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Extendable>).

If you need a lot of customizations you should think about building your own
class and maybe use L<AnyEvent::XMPP::CM> yourself. This module is just a small
helper to give people some bare set of usable defaults.

=head2 Extensions

Following extensions are loaded:

=over 4

=item AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Disco

=item AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Version

=item AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Presence

NOTE: It will send an initial available presence.

=item AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Roster

NOTE: The roster will be fetched automatically when you connect
to a server.

=item AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Delay

=item AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::LangExtract

=item AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MsgTracker

=item AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MUC

=back

For further details please consult the documentation of the extensions.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item my $im = AnyEvent::XMPP::IM->new (%args)

This class takes the same arguments as the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::CM>
class, as it is derived from it. And additionally you
can provide these:

=over 4

=item client_name => $name

This option is the name of the client (usually for Disco and Version
replies).
The default is 'AnyEvent::XMPP::IM';

=item client_version => $version

This option is the version of the client (usually for Version replies).
Default is the version of this module.

=item my ($private, $src_jid) = $im->send_message ($from_jid, $to_jid, $msg)

This method will send a text message C<$msg> from your account C<$from_jid> to
the JID C<$to_jid>.

It will be checked whether there exists a connected connection for
C<$from_jid>, and if not, an exception is thrown.

This method will also do the 'right thing' in case C<$to_jid> is
the JID of a MUC room you are joined.

In case C<$to_jid> is a bare JID it will also do the 'right thing' in case you
have a conversation with it. (The messages will be sent using the
L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MsgTracker> extension).

The method returns a true value in C<$private> if the message that was sent
privately to someone (in which case you will not get an echo back from
somewhere). C<$private> is false if it was delivered to a groupchat, where you
will get an echo from the MUC Room.

In C<$src_jid> the actual source resource JID of your XMPP account will be
returned, where the message was actually sent from.

   (1, $resjid)
}

=item my $nick = $im->nickname_for_jid ($accountjid, $jid)

This method will give you a nickname for the C<$jid> for the account
C<$accountjid>.  The nickname you set in the roster will be checked, and if
none is set some other default will be used (for instance the node part of the
JID).
